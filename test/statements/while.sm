#
# === WHILE STATEMENT ===
#
#   While statements take the form of:
#
#       while <expression> { ... }
#
#   The expression will be tested for truthiness (where
# every value except None and False are True). If the
# expression is truthy, then the body will be continually
# executed as long as the expression is truthy. There is
# the potential that the while loop will execute forever.
#   Only definition statements are allowed in the top-level
# so the examples in the file are all within the main
# definition.
